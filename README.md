## Unaconsulta - app for property reviews
This is my final project at Le Wagon coding bootcamp, built on Rails 6, JavaScript, HTML5, SCSS and Bootstrap.
It's an application for tenants to leave reviews on a property or room they've lived in, so people will know whether it has relevant problems or not.
